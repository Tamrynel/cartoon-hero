			<h2>What is Tea</h2>
			<p>Tea is an aromatic beverage commonly prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over cured leaves of the Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to Asia. After water, it is the most widely consumed drink in the world.</p>

			<h2>So how do you make Tea?</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Tea absorbs moisture and kitchen smells. To keep your tea fresh and avoid spoiling the flavour, keep loose tea or teabags in a sealed jar or tin.</li>
				<li>Tea loves oxygen â€“ it helps the flavour develop, so always use freshly drawn cold water in the kettle.</li>
				<li>If you are using one, make sure your tea pot is clean. Warm the pot by swirling a small amount of boiled water in it.</li>
				<li>For black tea, only pour on freshly boiled water and do not over-boil it.</li>
				<li>For green tea, always use the water just at the boil.</li>
				<li>One teaspoon of loose tea per person and one teaspoon for the pot is about right, but add as much or as little to make it to the strength you like.</li>
				<li>If you are using a teabag: you should allow the teabag to brew for two and a half to three minutes. This allows the flavour to fully develop. Then add milk or lemon or enjoy it black, whatever your preference.</li>
				<li>If you are using loose leaf tea: you should allow it to brew in a teapot for up to seven minutes. The general rule is: the larger the leaf, the longer the brewing time. Earl Grey and Lady Grey need five minutes, while a smaller leaf tea will only need about four minutes.</li>
				<li>Historically, the 'milk in first' rule was to protect the fine bone china it was served in - it's a very individual thing.</li>

			<h2>A song about tea</h2>
			<p>The kettle's boiled, the leaves are in the pot</p>
				<p>Pour the water slowly, just like you've been taught</p>
				<p>Let it brew for five minutes or more</p>
				<p>Hello, is it tea you're looking for?</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>Just a cup will never do</p>
				<p>It'll lead to three or four</p>
				<p>If you're somewhere feeling lonely</p>
				<p>Grab a mug and start to pour</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>Whether it's Oolong or Earl Grey</p>
				<p>Or an English Breakfast blend</p>
				<p>There is not a doubt that tea is</p>
				<p></p>Your best friend</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>You sit at work and watch the day go past</p>
				<p>Waiting for the time when you go home at last</p>
				<p>You turn the key and open your front door</p>
				<p>Hello, there is nothing you want more</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>Hello, there is nothing you want more</p>
				<p>Or a cup of camomile</p>
				<p>To recover from your sorrows</p>
				<p>And maybe bring a smile</p>
				<p> </p>
				<p>For you see life is not so bad</p>
				<p>And though trouble lies ahead</p>
				<p>Shut your mind and try to think of</p>
				<p>Tea instead</p>
				<p> </p>
